tut_menu_1;Basic Concepts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_menu_1_description;You will be guided through the basic concepts of East vs. West by an expert.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tut_menu_6;Intelligence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_menu_6_description;Knowledge is power! Don't forget this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_1;Welcome to East vs. West!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_2;War is coming, and you must be prepared for the storm. Before you guide your country to success we have arranged for some guidance from an expert. You are taken outside to meet a small man with a rather odd looking moustache; he is painting what can only be described as a singularly bad painting. He turns and stares at you in an almost manic manner and then begins a half hour rambling tirade about various subjects. You begin to suspect that the man might be mad. However he then begins to settle down and starts to explain what is going on.\n\n'To lead a nation to dominance you must have the facts at your fingertips, information is power. We must first master these if our will is to triumph. I will take you through each in turn, as soon as you are ready to continue hit the okay key. If you feel you are foolish enough to ignore my genius, then do it your way, I won't try to stop you...much.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_3;Basic Concepts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_4;The strange man starts to pace up and down, up and down, arms waving, voice rising and he speaks, yet to be honest it isn’t really worth getting worked up about. Is it?\n'- What kind of game is this? East vs. West is a Pausable Realtime Grand Strategy game.\nBy Grand Strategy we mean that you are in charge of the 'big picture,' your arena is the world and your pieces are divisions and armies. Pausable means that the game runs in realtime but you can at any time pause the game by pressing the pause key (circled), the Pause/Break-key or the Space key.\n-Who are you? You take on the role of the leader of a nation during the late 1940s. Your job will be to guide your nation through the turbulent Cold War era and make your faction come out on top by military, diplomatic, and industrial means.\n- How do you win? There is no predetermined set of victory conditions; what you wish to achieve is entirely up to you. You will of course take on the role of the USSR and lead the Communist faction to world conquest, but you might chose to pursue some sort of weak goal like to maintain the neutrality and independence of your small nation among hungry superpowers? You will find that there are victory points on the map (see the manual for more on victory points), these represent the value of a certain province and can be used to see how well you are doing compared to others.'';;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_5;Main window;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_6;He gestures towards the map and says, 'Most of the action in the game will take place on this map that covers the entire world, save the Poles.... I mean poles. This map is divided into regions for you to occupy and provinces to conquer.' He points out the Mini Map in the lower right corner and continues, 'This is your friend. Clicking here will allow you to jump around the globe quickly making your lightening attacks harder to parry. Above this you see several small buttons for switching Map Modes. These will colour the map in different ways according to which you select, my favourite is the one that shows all my lovely conquests.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_7;Natural resources;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_8;The strange little man looks like he is about to resume painting, although you really wish he would either shave or grow some sensible facial hair. However instead he points to where the resources are, 'Resources are vital for success. These are the basic inputs for your industry that in turn will fuel your war machine. You can increase the amount of resources through research and through conquest. There are also some fools, and they call me mad? Who would use trade to increase the number of resources despite the danger of it being interdicted during wartime. If you hover over the icons with your mouse you can get a further breakdown of where your resources are coming from and going to.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_8a;Energy - Such as coal and hydroelectric power. Used to power your industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_8b;Metal - Various common ores such as Iron. Used to power your industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_8c;Rare Materials - Thing such as Uranium and Rubber. Used to power your industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_8d;Crude Oil - The Black gold. Fuels your military forces once converted to fuel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_9;Industrial Capacity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_10;He moves on to Industrial Capacity, his eyes once again almost manic, and people call him mad, you start to wonder why not? He points 'This is the Industrial Capacity (IC) of your nation.\nThis is used to produce upgrade and reinforce you military units, if you allow your military to languish then it will mean death for your nation. Regrettably it also has to be used to keep your civilians happy.\n The three numbers next to the factory icon are of vital significance these describe (from left to right) your Waste IC, Available IC  and Base IC.\n\nBase IC is important, it represents the total number of factories in your nation.\nAvailable IC is your IC that you can actually use, this include modifiers by technology and excellent administrators, plus if you have failed to conquer enough resources this will lower this number.\nWasted IC is a sign that people are sabotaging the war effort and this should be dealt with immediately. This IC could be used right now to create more lovely tank divisions to liberate your neighbours with.\n\nWe will discuss this further in a later chapter.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_11;Manpower and Leadership;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_12;Manpower represents the brave men who will die for the fatherland, you will use these hardy souls to build new units and reinforce existing ones.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_13;Ah business as usual, you start to feel quite comfortable with the knowledge that the little man is in fact insane. However what does that make you? No time to ponder this question and the little man moves on to the next important topic. 'Conquest requires leadership, you need to harness the ‘brightest and the best’ in your nation. We can store three types of leadership for use later.' :;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_13a;Diplomatic Influence - Used to undertake diplomatic missions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_13b;Spies - Used to find out more about your enemies or to undertake covert operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_13c;Officers - The leaders of your armies. The ratio of officers to the number of units affects the efficiency of your units.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_14;Dissent and National Unity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_15;The home front is of vital importance, speaking from personal experience here, wars can be lost due to the home front collapsing and nothing what so ever to do with the overwhelming forces arrayed against you.' You ponder this statement for a minute and realise that it really doesn’t have to actually make any sense, the little man continues 'Dissent is how the common people are feeling, being the fools that they are they can easily be bribed by consumer goods. As dissent rises, your industry will start to suffer, your production starts to fall and even revolts can occur. Remember to always keep the masses bribed.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_16;National Unity is even more significant than dissent. This number represents the willingness of the people at the top to fight until total victory no matter how many temporary set backs you may suffer.' Well you suppose that is one way to describe staring defeat in the face.\n'Espionage and strategic warfare can affect this, so remember if the Schweinhunds start bombing your cities our mighty airforce will sweep them from the skies.' ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_17;This concluded the chapter about the map and the main interface, the next chapter will deal with the art of diplomacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_18;Produced Goods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_19;It is starting to worry you, the little man is starting to make sense, although the painting still looks terrible. He quickly moves on, 'These icons represents resources that are produced by your country as opposed to the natural resources that are extracted from the land.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_20;Supplies represent most of the things your armies need to fight a war, such as ammunition, food and clothing. The more units you have the more supply you will consume. Should you run out of supply your units will start to loose strength and fighting efficiency. Supply is produced by your industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_21;Fuel is the lifeblood of mechanised war. Fuel in converted from oil at a fixed rate, this rate can be improved via technology;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_22;Money is used to buy goods on the world market. You get money by producing Consumer Goods (and bought your population) or selling goods to other nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_1;Diplomatic Screen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_2;After some of the more interesting views expressed in the previous chapter you are rather surprised to see that your guide is back to explain the joys of diplomacy. However it seems diplomacy has some place in the twisted mind that produces those strangely bad paintings.\n'First you access the diplomacy screen by clicking here', strangely enough he points at the button marked diplomacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_3;Relations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_4;He now points to the country list, 'The first thing you should notice in this screen is the list of nations in the world and how much they threaten you. Also notice it gives a list of resources you have in supply and need. This is handy if you wish to trade, but more importantly it tells you which countries to invade and take what you need.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_5;Factions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_6;He points to the faction screen, you wonder which way he is going to spin this one and will he save sometime soon? 'Look carefully you can see the three factions who fight for influence, this is important.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_6a;Allies - The weak and spineless forces of democracy and the preservers of status quo.:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_6b;'Axis - The 'have nots', the autocratic nations that are just waiting for the right leader to lead them to their destiny.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_6c;Commintern - The embodiment of all that is evil and the international proletariat led by the Soviet Union.:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_7;You begin to suspect that the strange little man may in fact be a bit biased, you start to wonder what they were thinking when they picked him. If it was nothing to do with information then it was perhaps for the sheer comedy value of some of his statements. 'Here you can see which nations are members of the various factions, notice the number of weak fools in the alliance, they are already half way to defeat. You can also see the total amount of victory points accumulated by each faction, it is nice to see who is winning.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_8;The faction triangle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_9;The little man turns his attention to the faction triangle. 'Here we can see the relative positions of countries to the three factions. Countries will drift naturally according to various factors into alignment with one of the factions, although this may take some time for some nations. You can also use your diplomatic influence to cause countries to drift into your faction, allowing you to assemble a coalition of mighty allies.'\nYou start to wonder what a mind as special as this one, would consider to be mighty allies and then decide it is probably best not to speculate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_10;Sorting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_11;Sometimes not any country will do. This is especially so when you are declaring war, you need to make sure the correct evil neighbour is being conquered this time.' He points to the buttons, 'With these handy buttons you can filter out future targets.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_12;Diplomatic Actions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_13;Here is where you declare war upon people. I have heard it has other uses too. Most of these actions will cost you diplomatic influence points.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_14;Decisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_15;Some nations have important decisions they can take to help further their goals. Take Germany for example, you can reoccupy the Rhineland and bring Austria back into the Reich.' At this point the little man goes off a half hour rant about the subject. You gather that Austria has some special significance to the little man, maybe it was they who tampered with his moustache? Perhaps he will draw you a picture to explain this, but you hope not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_16;This concludes the tutorial on the diplomatic view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_1;Production Screen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_2;Once again the strange little man is back. He has resumed painting. You try to avert your eyes. Then he turns to you and says, 'Now we will discuss production. This is the screen were you build units.\nYou click here to access it.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_3;Production Screen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_4;This is the production screen, one of the most important there is.' The little man’s icy calm is even more unnerving than his moustache at the moment, you preferred it when he was ranting. 'You find everything pertaining to your industry and most important of all, you build armies here.' ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_5;Distribution Sliders;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_6;He points over to the industry sliders, 'These are used to distribute your Industrial Capacity (IC). IC is vitally important for your war effort and these sliders should never be neglected.\n You can allocate IC amongst the following:';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_6a;Upgrades – Our elite scientists are constantly developing new ways to help us liberate our neighbours. Allocating ICs here pays the costs for upgrading your units to newer models. The need value tells you how much it costs to upgrade all upgradable units at max speed. If Need is 0, all units have the best available model.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_6b;Reinforcements – War has a habit of creating new heroes for the fatherland. IC here goes towards resupplying those units that have taken losses with new men and materials. If need is 0, all units are at max strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_6c;Supplies – As a frontline soldier myself I can speak from personal experience here, an army needs tons of supplies to keep functioning, ammunition, spare parts, food, the list goes on. IC allocated here produces those supplies that your troops need to fight the war. The need value represents what your units consume each day. Any excess supply is stockpiled for future needs or for export.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_6d;Production – Expanding your army is important if you want to keep the ground you have conquered, these cost IC. Need tells you how much is needed to produce everything in the production queue at full speed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_6e;Consumer Goods – The home front must never be neglected, IC allocated here produces consumer goods for your people. The Need value tells you how much you need to produce to keep dissent from rising. It is highly recommended that you produce at least this amount, a dissatisfied population is a dangerous thing. The amount of consumer goods you produce also determines your money income.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_7;As someone who knows a thing or two about running a country here is my pro-tips for balancing your sliders: 1. You can lock a certain slider by right clicking a drag button. 2. You can automatically set a slider to its Need value by clicking the value.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_8;Build Queue;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_9;Knowing what you have in production is of vital significance, some units can take over a year to produce this can have a great influence on your strategy.' He points to the screen. 'Above this is were you select new things to produce. As I know you have countries to conquer we will keep it brief and look just at the Division designer.' ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_10;Division Designer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_11;This is the Division designer where you can design and build divisions for your army. On the top right you see buttons for preset templates, on the left you can see the division components that you can build. There are other simpler interfaces for other units, but to take and hold provinces requires land units. This is the key one'  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_12;Division Designer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_13;To truly conquer the whole world we need powerful divisions to crush our enemies, this is how we do this.' You feel slightly relieved at this point, the strange little man has been far too reasonable, almost sane in fact, but now you are back on familiar ground. 'Division are made from brigades and at the moment we can only have 4, but our troops are so good we only need 4. The important thing here is to remember that each brigade confers abilities on a unit but does so at a cost. Finding the right blend between this is of vital significance if you wish to conquer. Different combination will be effective in different situations. You can do this manually or you can pick one of the predefined templates. Here is our 1936 model armoured division, pretty good isn’t it?' ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_14;Start Production;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_15;Once you have selected the division you want, you then need to make three more decisions. This is where a true leader comes to the fore.' He starts to rant on about the importance of leadership and will. You are not sure what you would get when a relative dies has to do with building divisions, but it seems to be important. The rant stops and he continues, 'First note, you can build units as reserve, these are at reduced strength and cannot move, only when they are mobilised are they free to move and will be steadily reinforced up to full strength.\nNext choice is how many division to build at one time, this is as much a question of an efficient use of your time than anything else. Time is an important commodity and the less time you use here the more you can be focusing on conquering your neighbours and restoring your nation to greatness. Finally you have serial and parallel builds.  If you build them in parallel all the units will be built at once, serial builds mean the units will be built one after the other.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_16;Production Screen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_17;Well now you know the basics it is time to move on and to how to make you armies the best that they can be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_1;Technology Screen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_2;The strange little man is back to tell you about technology, 'Technology is of vital significance to modern war. Napoleon boasted that moral was more important than manpower, but he was a fool, equipment and training is what matters. Napoleon was a fool because he was French.' He then embarks on a rather long rant about France and French people. You get the impression that he doesn’t like them much, perhaps he had a bad experience when visiting there in his younger days? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_3;Leadership;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_4;Let’s start with Leadership,' he points to the box in the top left of the screen, 'these represent the brightest and best of your nations, and these leaders can be distributed amongst the following:':;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_4a;Research – What we are here to talk about today, the more points assigned here the more simultaneous research project you can run';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_4b;Espionage – Investing leadership in this area allows us to accumulate espionage points that are used to carry out covert actions.'  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_4c;Diplomacy – For those foolish enough to indulge in the weak act of diplomacy instead of true conquest, you can waste leadership here to do this.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_4d;Officers – These represent junior grade officers and NCOs, and this is vitally important. If your officer to division ratio is too low your divisions will struggle to hold together in combat.' ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_5;As with the production sliders you can lock them by right clicking on the drag button.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_6;Projects;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_7;Technology is divided up into projects. Although you can select as many projects as you like, the number that actually advance is determined by the amount of leadership you assign to research.\n Over each project you can see a green bar, this shows your current tech level. Some technologies can only be researched once, while others can be pursued an unlimited number of times.' ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_8;To start a research project you must first select the tech and then hit the start research button. If this button is greyed out then you do not yet have the prerequisite techs researched. Hover the cursor over the start research button to find out which.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_9;The length of time it takes to complete a research project depends on a number of factors:':;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_9a;Theory and Practical – This represents your accumulated experience your nation has with these technologies, this experience reduces the time needed to complete a research project. The icons below represent which fields influences the research project.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_9b;Difficulty Level – Some research is naturally harder than others to achieve, the more difficult a project is the longer it will take to finish.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_9c;Year -  This represents the time taken to assimilate new knowledge. Each time you research a project this year advances. Eventually the year will be further than the current game year. At this point the research project becomes more difficult to pursue.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_10;Theory And Practical.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_11;Theory is your theoretical understanding of a research field. Researching a technology will advance theory in a given field.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_12;Practical is your nation’s practical understanding of a technology's use. Building most types of units will increase your practical knowledge.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_1;Politics Screen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_2;Your guide is back for another instalment of the tutorial, the painting is nowhere is sight, but the strange moustache is still very much in evidence. 'In this chapter we will be looking at you nations internal politics, here you can hire and fire ministers, institute elections and, if your nation is weak enough, monitor elections.'  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_3;Your Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_4;The first step to a successful war is to understand how you country works.' He points to the box in the top right hand corner of the screen. 'Here you can see the governing party of your country, to the left you can see your governing ideology and when the next election is due. As you can see here, Germany has unshackled itself from the fetters of democracy and is free to be guided by superior leadership.' You ponder this statement carefully.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_5;The Cabinet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_6;This is your cabinet that governs your nation.' He points over to the cabinet. 'Each minister has traits that affects how your nation runs. If you click on the replace button you can remove a minister and replace him with someone more suited to your needs.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_7;Parties;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_8;Here we see the parties that exist in your country. There is one for each ideology and the ideologies are colour #CODEd. Each party has an organisation and a popularity rating. Party popularity can be a requirement to pass laws, if you are one of those strange people who like elections a popular party is more likely to win. Organisation is how well organised the party is, the more organised a party is the easier it will gain popularity with the easily lead masses.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_9;Laws;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_10;Laws are of vital significance in the functioning of your country. By clicking on a law you can see if there are other options available. Most laws have requirements for selection.' ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_11;Occupation Policies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_12;Occupation policies are without doubt the most important part of the politics screen. Here you decide how much to exploit the people you occupy. The harsher you treat them the more production they will provide for your war machine, at the same time you will find it harder to recruit manpower and leadership from them. Some places are only fit for exploitation, and leave your armies to crush all resistance.' You could sworn the little man had at one point used the word liberation to describe conquering other countries, this is a new definition of the word liberation you were not aware off. He is definitely mad, but is there method in his madness?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_13;Strategic Warfare;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_14;This is the second most important part of the interface to understand. These are the modifiers to your national unity brought on by the war. Since you have received my superior guidance you will obviously be winning, it is more important to understand these in the context of other countries.' Considering the overall sanity rating of the little man’s advice you question this statement a bit. :;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_14a;Convoys – Sinking enemy convoys will reduce their national unity as the navy appears impotent in the face of our manifest superiority. If they manage to engage our forces successfully, national unity will increase.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_14b;Allies – The commitment of allied troops in the defence of a country will strengthen the resolve to continue the fight. This is important on both the attack and the defence. When attacking, be sure to target allied troops to remove the prop to civilian moral they give. The use of your own troops can help your wavering allies who are without the kind of leadership only my guidance can provide.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_14c;Bombing – Strategic bombing will weaken the resolve of your enemies, should their air force intercept your bombers this will boost their national unity. A sudden strike by bombers can force the surrender of an already wavering enemy. While against a more resilient foe, strategic bombing can force their air force into a defensive battle of attrition allowing you to gain air superiority elsewhere.' ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_15;Politics Screen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_16;This concludes the tutorial of the politics screen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_1;Intelligence Screen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_2;The little man is back and he has invited you into his bunker, you wonder if perhaps he thinks that somehow you are his friend, you hope not. 'Now for the last part of our lessons in statecraft, the intelligence service. Here I will show you how to control your nation’s intelligence service and see some of the data they collect.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_3;Internal Espionage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_4;Here you see the status of your intelligence service with special focus on your domestic intelligence service. Here you get information about unemployed spies, the number of spies operating abroad, the number of spies operating at home and how effective partisan operations are inside your country.\nYou can select a focus for you domestic spies, this will be their main mission. They won’t neglect their other tasks, but they will be nowhere near as affective at them. These can be:\n\nCounter Espionage – Finding and removing of enemy spies from your nation.\n\nSupport Ruling Party – Improve our ruling party’s organisation by various means of persuasion.\n\nLower Neutrality – Prepare your people for inevitable war that is coming so you can get down to business quicker.' ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_5;Other Nations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_6;If you desire peace you must prepare for war. No one desires peace more than I do which is why constant war preparation is important, and well, let’s face it, it would be a shame to put all those preparations to waste.' By now you have got used to the amazing mental gymnastics the strange little man’s mind can pull, the moustache though, is another matter all together. He continues 'Spying on other nations is an important part of war preparations and also in war. Here we can see a list of all the countries in the world, with a bit of work you can make this smaller and more manageable. Beside each country is their threat to us and our relationship to them. You can also see the number of spies you currently have infiltrated. The final part displays the priority for sending new spies.\n\nClicking on a nations will select it.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_7;Country Information;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_8;First let me direct your attention here.' He points over to the right hand side of the screen. 'Here we can see information about that country. They are divided up into country statistics, current party popularity, technology and their military. Your intelligence is not always either accurate or complete, this is why you need to be a great leader. A great leader will be able to take these incomplete reports and sense weakness, know exactly when to strike.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_9;Sending Spies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_10;This is where you send spies to a nation. Well actually people like us are far too important to bother with it, instead you set the priority for the country and then let the intelligence minister do the rest. The big red number and bar underneath show the number of spies you have in the country.\nBelow that you can see the priority for spy sending. The priority is set between 0 and 3. We won’t send spies to priority 0 countries, but as new spies become available they will be distributed according to priority between countries that have space for new spies.\nThe counter espionage value lets you know how many spies are currently hunting ours. Again you have to be careful here as this information isn’t accurate.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_11;Missions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_12;Finally here is where you decide which mission you should focus on, some will help, others will hinder. Use the helpful ones for you friends, or future conquests, as I like to call them, and hinder your enemies. At all times your agents will continue to gather some information about the country, although focusing in on specific information will improve it’s quality. Note, you can only do one mission per nation.' ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_13;Intelligence Screen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_14;Well that is me passed on all the important information on statecraft, I hope it was a useful experience.' You shake your head sadly, the strange little man looks a bit crest fallen. He disappears into another room in the bunker and you hear a single gunshot. All you are left with are some unsettling memories and a very very bad painting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
