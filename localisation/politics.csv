non-interventionism_desc;Non-interventionism is about avoiding alliances with other nations and avoiding all wars not related to direct self-defense. We still practice active diplomacy, but we do not interfere in the internal politics of other states or attempt to shape the international status quo. Instead, we seek to enjoy the benefits of neutrality by not becoming involved in conflicts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

collaboration_government_desc;Instead of governing these conquered territories directly, we can support local sympathizers to govern in our name. By creating a buffer between ourselves and the populace, we reduce the temptation of people to form resistance movements and the collaboration government will encourage like-minded citizens to join our cause. However, they are also highly sensitive to their lack of legitimacy and won’t be able to do anything to jeopardize their support. This lack of unilateral control will make it harder for us to exploit the area economically.;Au lieu de gouverner directement ces territoires conquis, on peut soutenir les sympathisants locaux pour qu'ils gouvernent à notre place. En créant un tampon entre le peuple et nous, les gens sont moins tentés de former des mouvements de résistance et le;Anstatt diese eroberten Gebiete direkt zu regieren, können wir lokale Sympathisanten in unserem Namen mit dieser Aufgabe betrauen. Durch Schaffung eines Puffers zwischen uns und der Bevölkerung verringern wir das Risiko, dass sich Widerstandsbewegungen gründen. Darüber hinaus wird die Kollaborationsregierung gleichgesinnten Bürgern nahelegen, unserer Sache beizutreten. Andererseits ist sie sich aber auch der fehlenden Legitimität ihrer Herrschaft bewusst und wird daher nichts unternehmen, was ihren Rückhalt in der Bevölkerung gefährden könnte. Dies macht es uns schwerer, das Gebiet wirtschaftlich auszubeuten.;;En vez de gobernar directamente los territorios conquistados, podemos apoyar a simpatizantes locales para que lo hagan en nuestro nombre. Si creamos un amortiguador entre nosotros y la población, reduciremos su tentación de resistirse y el Gobierno colaboracionista animará a los ciudadanos de su órbita a unirse a nuestra causa. Aun así, también son muy sensibles a su falta de legitimidad y no harán nada que ponga el peligro sus apoyos, dificultando nuestra explotación económica de la zona.;;;;;;;;;x

military_government_desc;By turning government over to our military authorities, the area will be governed by means of a highly literal interpretation of the laws. This is a more efficient way to exploit an area economically than a collaboration government, but a slightly less literal interpretation would allow even more resources to be gathered. Because the government has little sensitivity to local conditions, the people will not be happy, but at the same time the legalistic framework means that people enjoy some stability and will not become truly miserable because of our rule.;En plaçant le gouvernement entre les mains de nos autorités militaires, elles gouverneront en prenant les lois au pied de la lettre. C'est une manière plus efficace d'exploiter une région économiquement que le gouvernement de collaboration mais une interp;Die Übergabe der Regierungsgewalt an unsere Militärbürokratie wird in einer sehr strengen Ausübung der Gesetze resultieren. Auf diese Weise kann ein Gebiet wirtschaftlich effizienter ausgebeutet werden, als es unter einer Kollaborationsregierung möglich wäre, doch durch eine weniger strenge Gesetzesauslegung könnten sogar noch mehr Ressourcen gesammelt werden. Da es der Militärregierung an Feingefühl für die örtliche Situation fehlt, wird die lokale Bevölkerung nicht zufrieden sein, doch die strenge Gesetzeslage hält den Deckel auf dem kochenden Topf des Volkszorns.;;Si entregamos el gobierno a las autoridades militares, estas gobernarán con una interpretación muy literal de las reglas. Esto es un modo más eficaz de explotar una zona económicamente que con el Gobierno colaboracionista, pero una interpretación menos literal permitiría la adquisición de incluso más recursos. Dado que el Gobierno tiene una escasa sensibilidad hacia las condiciones locales, el pueblo no estará contento, pero, asimismo, el importante marco legal implica que podría estar más descontento si cabe.;;;;;;;;;x

full_occupation_desc;Using civilian administrators and focusing on gaining economic advantage from our occupied territories, we can increase the amount of resources we gather from the area. However, astoundingly, being forced to work for the benefit of our war machine isn’t something that the local population will look forward to, and as such local resistance movements will have an easier time gathering support.;En utilisant des administrateurs civils qui concentrent leurs efforts sur l'obtention d'avantages économiques dans nos territoires occupés, nous pouvons augmenter la quantité de ressources en provenance de cette région. Mais bizarrement, les citoyens ne s;Mit Hilfe von Zivilverwaltern, die sich darauf konzentrieren, aus den von uns besetzten Gebieten wirtschaftlich Kapital zu schlagen, können wir die Anzahl der aus diesen Gebieten gewonnenen Ressourcen noch steigern. Aus irgendeinem Grund kann sich die lokale Bevölkerung jedoch etwas Besseres vorstellen, als zur Arbeit in unserer Kriegsmaschinerie gezwungen zu werden - was auch erklärt, warum sich die lokalen Widerstandsbewegungen enormen Zulaufs erfreuen.;;Si los administradores civiles se centran en obtener ventajas económicas de nuestros territorios ocupados, podemos aumentar los recursos obtenidos de dichas zonas. No obstante, verse obligados a trabajar para el beneficio de nuestra maquinaria bélica no es lo más deseable para el pueblo, y es una forma de que los movimientos de resistencia locales ganen apoyos.;;;;;;;;;x

total_exploitation_desc;The gloves are off, and we don’t care if you are a totally corrupt carpetbagger so long as you know how to exploit a country and pay us our due. These are the kinds of people we are going to unleash on the populace, and their actions will carry the full weight of our law. This will maximize our own benefits, with some of the proceeds being lost to ensure that our ‘administrators’ are properly rewarded. Of course the local population will become upset at this, but that’s why we supply our occupation troops with so much ammunition.;"On ne prend plus de gants, ça nous est égal que vous soyez un opportuniste corrompu jusqu'à la moelle, tant que vous savez comment exploiter un pays. C'est le genre de personne qu'on va lâcher sur la population. Cela va maximiser nos bénéfices mais on devra prendre compte quelques pertes, afin de s'assurer que nos administrateurs"" soient récompensés comme ils le méritent. Cela risque de ne pas plaire aux gens mais bon, on doit bien veiller à ce que nos troupes d'occupation gardent la forme.";So, jetzt ist Schluss mit lustig! ‘Sie sind völlig korrupt und lügen, dass sich die Balken biegen? Ist uns alles egal, wenn Sie nur wissen, wie man ein Land ausbeutet!’ Diese Art von Leuten werden wir nun auf die Bevölkerung loslassen. Dadurch werden wir unsere Gewinne maximieren, auch wenn unsere sauberen ‘Verwalter’ einen Teil für sich selbst abzweigen. Natürlich wird sich die Bevölkerung gegen sie auflehnen, aber was soll's? Schusstraining unter Realbedingungen für unsere Besatzungstruppen ist nie verkehrt ...;;Guantes fuera. No nos importa si eres un aventurero corrupto, siempre que sepas como explotar el país. Este es el tipo de personas que esquilman a la población. Así, maximizaremos nuestros beneficios, perdiendo parte de ellos para asegurar que nuestros administradores reciban su recompensa.
