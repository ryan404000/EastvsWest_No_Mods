hardline_pol_desc;In politics, 'hardline' refers to the doctrine, policy, and posturing of a government or political body as being absolutist and sometimes authoritarian. The hardline position is usually extremist and uncompromising. The term hardliner can be synonymous with the term 'hawk' and is often used derogatively. It can be used to refer to individuals within a political, special interest, or activist movement of almost any ideology. A hardliner is someone who sticks to his point rigorously and does not readily adopt dissenting ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
power_projection_pol_desc;Power projection (or force projection) is a term used in military and political science to refer to the capacity of a state to conduct expeditionary warfare, i.e. to intimidate other nations and implement policy by means of force, or the threat thereof, in an area distant from its own territory. This ability is a crucial element of a state's power in international relations. Any state able to direct its military forces outside the limited bounds of its territory might be said to have some level of power projection capability, but the term is used most frequently to refer to militaries with a worldwide reach (or at least significantly broader than a state's immediate surroundings).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
engagement_and_enlargement_pol_desc;Rollback is a term for the use of military force to 'roll back' communism in countries where it had taken root. In political science, rollback is the strategy of forcing change in the major policies of a state, usually by replacing its ruling regime. It contrasts with 'containment,' which means preventing the expansion of a state, and with 'detente,' which means establishing a working relationship with a state. Most of the discussions of rollback in the scholarly literature deal with United States foreign policy toward Communist countries during the Cold War. The rollback strategy was tried, and failed, in Korea in 1950 and in Cuba in 1961, but succeeded in the 1953 Iranian coup d'etat, in Chile (1973), in Grenada (1983), in Panama (1989), and in Iraq (2003). Today rollback is sometimes called 'regime change,' and it was later included to an extent in the 'Clinton Doctrine' and the 'Engagement and Enlargement' strategy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
containment_pol_desc;Containment was a United States policy that used numerous strategies to prevent the spread of communism abroad. A component of the Cold War, this policy was a response to a series of moves by the Soviet Union to enlarge communist influence in Eastern Europe, China, Korea, and Vietnam. It represented a middle-ground position between detente and rollback. The basis of the doctrine was articulated in a 1946 cable by U.S. diplomat George F. Kennan. As a description of U.S. foreign policy, the word originated in a report Kennan submitted to U.S. Defense Secretary James Forrestal in 1947, a report that was later used in a magazine article. It is a translation of the French term 'cordon sanitaire' used to describe Western policy toward the Soviet Union in the 1920s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
detente_pol_desc;The term 'detente' is often used to refer to the general easing of geopolitical tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States that began in 1971. As implemented in United States foreign policy, U.S. presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford labeled the concept of detente as a 'thawing out' or an 'un-freezing' during a period roughly in the middle of the Cold War. Detente was known in Russian as 'razryadka' (loosely meaning 'relaxation of tension'). The period was characterized by the signing of treaties such as SALT I and the Helsinki Accords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
appeasement_pol_desc;Appeasement is a diplomatic policy aimed at avoiding war by making concessions to an aggressor. Historian Paul Kennedy defines it as 'the policy of settling international quarrels by admitting and satisfying grievances through rational negotiation and compromise, thereby avoiding the resort to an armed conflict which would be expensive, bloody, and possibly dangerous.' Kennedy's definition has been widely cited by scholars. Appeasement was used by European democracies in the 1930s who wished to avoid war with the dictatorships of Germany and Italy, bearing in mind the horrors of World War I./nThe term is most often applied to the foreign policy of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain towards Nazi Germany between 1937 and 1939. His policies of avoiding war with Germany have been the subject of intense debate for seventy years among academics, politicians and diplomats. Historians' assessments have ranged from condemnation for allowing Adolf Hitler's Germany to grow too strong, to the judgment that he had no alternative and acted in Britain's best interests. At the time, these concessions were widely seen as positive, and the Munich Pact that was signed on 30 September 1938 by Germany, Britain, France, and Italy prompted Chamberlain to announce that he had secured 'peace for our time'. The word 'appeasement' has been used as a synonym for weakness and even cowardice since the late 1930s, and it is still used in that sense to denounce policies and behaviors that conflict with firm, often armed, responses to violent threats in international relations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
dove_policy_pol_desc;In politics, the term 'dove' refers to a person who advocates peace, conciliation, or negotiation over confrontation or armed conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
isolationism_pol_desc;Isolationism is the policy or doctrine of isolating one's country from the affairs of other nations by declining to enter into alliances, foreign economic commitments, foreign trade, international agreements, etc. An isolationist country seeks to devote its entire effort to its own development and to remain at peace by avoiding foreign entanglements and responsibilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
wet_operations_pol_desc;Wetwork or 'wet work' is a euphemism for murder or assassination, alluding to spilling blood. The expression 'wet work,' as well as the similar 'wet job,' 'wet affair,' or 'wet operation,' are all loanwords of the euphemism used by the KGB for such activities – 'mokroye delo' (wet work). These operations are reputed to have been handled at the KGB by Spetsburo 13, colorfully known as the 'Department of wet affairs' (Otdel mokrykh del). Assassins are referred to as 'wet boys.' The Russian expression 'wet work' can be traced to at least the 19th century from Russian criminal slang (such as 'fenya,' 'muzyka') and originally meant robbery that involved murder, i.e., spilling blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
false_flag_operations_pol_desc;False flag, a long-accepted ruse de guerre, is a practice originating in naval combat where a belligerent would deceptively hoist a battle flag not his own before engaging an enemy. It is also considered acceptable in certain circumstances during land warfare to deceive enemies, providing that the deception is not perfidious and all such deceptions are discarded before opening fire upon the enemy. Similarly, covert military or paramilitary operations designed to appear as though they are being carried out by third party entities may be described operating under a false flag or black flag. Operations carried during peace-time by civilian organizations as well as covert government agencies may by extension be called false flag operations if they seek to conceal the identity of the real organization behind an operation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
covert_ops_pol_desc;A covert operation(also 'CoveOps' or 'covert ops') is an operation that is planned and executed in such a way that the identity of the sponsor is undeterminable or at least plausibly deniable. It is intended to create a political effect with implications in the military, intelligence, or law enforcement areas. Covert operations aim to fulfill their mission objectives without any party knowing who sponsored or carried out the operation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
intelligence_gathering_pol_desc;Intelligence is a military or government term referring to the information used in making decisions. Intelligence can be any source of information suitably assessed and processed according to established methods. An important form of intelligence is so-called 'signals intelligence', which attempts to intercept electronic communications and other signals sent between parties working for a entity of interest – even between neutral or even friendly parties. In established intelligence agencies, intelligence gathering usually operates according to a linear structure, with an agent handler who directs the activities of a number of persons and sources in order to obtain the necessary facts about the target of the intelligence gathering operation. The two main human intelligence agent types used are infiltration and penetration agents. An infiltration agent is someone who enters the target of the operation from the outside, but on a suitable pretext so that they are not suspected of espionage. A penetration agent is a person already on the inside of the target area who is recruited by the handler. The gathered information is processed by one or more analysts and turned into an intelligence product. Information is conveyed between agents and handlers by a variety of secure or clandestine means, whether physical or electronic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
counter_intelligence_focus_pol_desc;Counterintelligence refers to efforts made by intelligence organizations to prevent hostile intelligence organizations from successfully gathering intelligence against them. Any friendly intelligence-gathering operation is vulnerable to attack, and it is the role of the intelligence agency to defend against such intrusions. A number of disciplines are involved in counterintelligence because of the wide range of potential threats, and threat assessment is a key objective of counterintelligence operations. Once a threat is ascertained, measures can be put in place to counter it and to thwart attempted attacks. Many governments organize counterintelligence agencies separate and distinct from their intelligence collection services for these specialized purposes. In most countries, the counterintelligence mission is spread over multiple organizations, though one single agency usually predominates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
industrial_espionage_focus_pol_desc;Industrial espionage is a form of espionage conducted for commercial purposes instead of purely national security purposes. Economic espionage is conducted or orchestrated by governments and is international in scope, while industrial espionage is more often national and occurs between companies or corporations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
signals_intelligence_pol_desc;Signals intelligence is intelligence-gathering by interception of signals, whether between people, involving electronic signals not directly used in personal communication, or combinations of the two. Because sensitive information is often encrypted, signals intelligence often involves the use of cryptanalysis. Also, 'traffic analysis'—the study of who is signaling whom and in what quantity—can often produce valuable information even when the messages themselves cannot be decrypted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
coup_facilitating_ops_pol_desc;A 'coup d'etat,' also known as a coup, a putsch, or an overthrow, is the sudden, illegal deposition of a government, usually by a small group of the existing state establishment to depose the current government and replace it with another body. A coup d'etat is considered successful when the usurpers establish their dominance. When the coup neither fails completely nor succeeds, thus leaving two hostile centers of power within a country, civil war is a likely consequence. A coup d'etat typically uses the existing government's legal power to assume political control of the country, but then modifies the previous government’s structures via pseudo-legal processes to ensure that the usurpers cannot legally be ousted from power, e.g. by declaring a permanent state of emergency or by rewriting portions of the country’s constitution. In Coup d'Etat: A Practical Handbook, military historian Edward Luttwak states that 'coup consists of the infiltration of a small, but critical, segment of the state apparatus, which is then used to displace the government from its control of the remainder.' A coup d'etat need not be orchestrated by the military; political maneuvering punctuated with targeted acts of violence can be just as effective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
conventional_warfare_focus_pol_desc;Conventional warfare is a method of warfare conducted using conventional military weapons and battlefield tactics between two or more states in open confrontation. In conventional warfare, the forces on each side are well-defined and fight using weapons that primarily target the opposing army. Conventional warfare is normally fought using conventional weapons as opposed to chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. The general purpose of conventional warfare is to weaken or destroy an opponent's military force and thereby destroy its ability to engage in further conventional warfare. The traditional foreign policy objective of conventional warfare is to force an enemy country to capitulate. In forcing capitulation, however, one or both sides may eventually resort to unconventional warfare tactics, especially when conventional warfare methods produce a stalemate or when one belligerent is severely outclassed by the other in its ability to wage a conventional war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
combined_arms_focus_pol_desc;Combined arms is an approach to warfare which seeks to integrate different branches of a military to achieve mutually complementary effects (for example, using infantry and armor in an urban environment, where one supports the other, or both support each other). For example, a modern armored division consists of a mixture of infantry, tank, artillery, reconnaissance, and perhaps even helicopter units, all coordinated and directed by a unified command structure.\nModern combined arms doctrine was pioneered in WWI to overcome the stalemate of trench warfare — by 1918, armies had learned to effect significant breakthroughs by coordinating rolling artillery barrages with infantry-supported armor. The Soviet Union developed this concept even further in the interwar period, boasting a sophisticated combined arms approach to warfare in the 1930s. Although its leadership initially proved incapable of executing this innovative doctrine due to Stalin’s repressions of the Red Army officer corps, by the end of WWII the Red Army enjoyed effective leadership and was able to apply its earlier theories on combined arms to devastating effect. After WWII, the USSR applied the lessons it had learned and developed both the first infantry fighting vehicle, the BMP-1, and the iconic AK-47. \nThe Vietnam War shaped the United States’ approach to combined arms warfare, demonstrating the effectiveness of rapid deployment of infantry forces by helicopter. The Vietnam War also witnessed the close integration of platoon-level ground forces and close air support (CAS) aircraft, made possible by advances in radio technology. These twin advances enabled the US to execute air assault missions — infantry was inserted via helicopter into hostile territory and, with the radio-coordinated CAS and artillery support, destroyed enemy positions and materiel. Similarly, extraction was executed quickly by helicopter. Air assault enabled the US to interdict Viet Kong and North Vietnamese operations without the need to take and hold large swaths of ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
assymetric_warfare_focus_pol_desc;Asymmetric warfare is war between belligerents whose relative military power differs significantly, or whose strategy or tactics differ significantly. 'Asymmetric warfare' can describe a conflict in which the resources of two belligerents differ in essence and in the struggle, interact and attempt to exploit each other's characteristic weaknesses. Such struggles often involve strategies and tactics of unconventional warfare, the weaker combatants attempting to use strategy to offset deficiencies in quantity or quality. Such strategies may not necessarily be militarized. This is in contrast to symmetric warfare, where two powers have similar military power and resources and rely on tactics that are similar overall, differing only in details and execution. The term is frequently used to describe what is also called 'guerrilla warfare', 'insurgency', 'terrorism', 'counterinsurgency', and 'counterterrorism', essentially violent conflict between a formal military and an informal, poorly equipped, but resilient opponent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
fighter_focus_pol_desc;A fighter aircraft is a military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat against other aircraft. The hallmarks of a fighter are its speed, maneuverability, and small size relative to other combat aircraft. A fighter's main purpose is to establish air superiority over a battlefield. Since World War I, achieving and maintaining air superiority has been essential for victory in conventional warfare. The success or failure of a belligerent's efforts to gain air supremacy hinges on several factors including the skill of its pilots, the tactical soundness of its doctrine for deploying its fighters, and the numbers and performance characteristics of those fighters. Because of the importance of air superiority, since the dawn of aerial combat armed forces have constantly competed to develop technologically superior fighters and to deploy these fighters in greater numbers. This policy focuses on that objective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
bomber_focus_pol_desc;This policy emphasizes the use of heavy bombers primarily designed for long-range bombing missions against strategic targets such as supply bases, bridges, factories, shipyards, and cities themselves in order to damage an enemy's war effort. The United States used its strategic bomber fleet to enormous effect in the fight to defeat Germany during WWII by systematically leveling entire cities. This policy focuses on the development, production, and application of strategic bombers to destroy the enemy’s capacity to make war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
close_air_support_focus_pol_desc;This policy focuses on the development and use of ground-attack aircraft designed for air-to-ground combat. Until precision-guided munitions became standard in 1960s, the term 'attack aircraft' implied a heavily armored aircraft armed with both bombs and forward-firing automatic weapons. Later, air forces tended to assign the ground-attack role to the ubiquitous multirole combat aircraft (sometimes described also as strike fighters). Notable exceptions include the American A-10 Thunderbolt and the Russian Sukhoi Su-25 Frogfoot. Attack helicopters are also prominent in the field of aircraft types built specifically for a ground-attack role.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
littoral_waters_focus_pol_desc;In the military context, littoral waters include areas of water, close to coasts, from which shore-based weapons can be a threat to major vessels afloat, where submarines can hide silently on the bottom, small craft can make speedy attacks from hiding places, and amphibious warfare is likely. A navy focusing on controlling littoral waters may represent first step in achieving the ability to sustain operations on the open ocean, or it may indicate a recognition that in future conflicts the navy’s ability to defeat lightly armed guerrillas in rubber boats will be more decisive than how effectively it can sink an enemy carrier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
blue_waters_focus_pol_desc;A blue-water navy is a maritime force capable of operating across the deep waters of open oceans. While definitions of what actually constitutes such a force vary, there is a requirement for the ability to exercise sea control at wide ranges. A blue-water navy allows a country to project power far from the home country and usually includes one or more aircraft carriers. Blue water navies also seek to control shipping lanes in times of war, both protecting friendly shipping and sinking enemy supply convoys. However, the chief objective of any blue water navy is to defeat the enemy’s naval forces in order to achieve dominance of the waves. Smaller blue-water navies are able to dispatch fewer vessels abroad for shorter periods of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
submarine_focus_pol_desc;This policy focus on the development and use of submarines. Military usage of submarine forces includes attacking enemy surface ships or submarines, aircraft carrier protection, blockade running, ballistic missile submarines as part of a nuclear strike force, reconnaissance, conventional land attack (for example using a cruise missile), and covert insertion of special forces. Submarines have one of the largest ranges of capabilities in any vessel, ranging from small autonomous examples to one- or two-person vessels operating for a few hours, to vessels which can remain submerged for 6 months while carrying nuclear ballistic missiles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
nuclear_armaments_focus_pol_desc;A nuclear weapon is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission or a combination of fission and fusion. Both reactions release vast quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter.  The first fission ('atomic') bomb test released the same amount of energy as approximately 20,000 tons of TNT. The first thermonuclear ('hydrogen') bomb test released the same amount of energy as approximately 10,000,000 tons of TNT. This policy focus on the development and use of such weapons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
astronautical_focus_pol_desc;This policy focuses on space technology, first to develop and implement spy satellites and finally to allow manned spaceflight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
basic_combat_training_pol_desc;Basic Combat Training (BCT) is where individuals learn about the fundamentals of being a soldier, from combat techniques to the proper way to address a superior. BCT is also where individuals undergo rigorous physical training to prepare their bodies and their minds for the physical and mental strain of combat. One of the most difficult and essential lessons learned in BCT is self-discipline, as it introduces prospective soldiers to a strict daily schedule that entails many duties and high expectations for which most civilians are not immediately ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
half_y_service_pol_desc;Half Year's Service expands Basic Combat Training time in order to achieve better-trained soldiers. More time in the military means that soldiers can train more in the specifics of their chosen field and perform better in combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
one_y_service_pol_desc;One Year's Service expands the Combat Training even further in order to achieve better-trained soldiers. More time in the military means that soldiers can train more in the specifics of their chosen field and perform better in combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
one_half_y_service_pol_desc;One and a Half Year's Service ensures thorough training of soldiers and enables them to perform well in combat. More specialized militaries need correspondingly more training time to be fully operational, e.g. with technically complex equipment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
two_y_service_pol_desc;Two Year's Service ensures even more thorough training of soldiers and enables them to excel in combat. More specialized militaries need correspondingly more training time to be fully operational, e.g. with technically complex equipment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
two_half_y_service_pol_desc;After two and a Half Year's Service you can be sure that your soldiers have profound knowledge of battle situations and are exceedingly proficient at waging of war. The long training time enables soldiers to become intimately familiar with complex equipment and therefore more effective when using it in combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
three_y_service_pol_desc;Three Year's Service ensures that your soldiers are a disciplined and professional fighting force, highly trained to respond to any combat situation and thoroughly drilled to make good use of even high complex technical equipment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
sustained_military_service_pol_desc;With sustained military service you can be sure that your country will at any time be able to field enough well trained soldiers to can handle any combat situation. Their high degree of training enables them to make good use of even highest-tech equipment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
military_nuclear_focus_pol_desc;This policy focuses on military nuclear equipment like ICBMs and tactical warheads. Nuclear reactors are mostly used to procure usable components for the military.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
mixed_nuclear_focus_pol_desc;This policy balances focus between military nuclear equipment and development of civilian nuclear power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
civilian_nuclear_focus_pol_desc;This policy focuses solely on civilian use of nuclear power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
nuclear_free_focus_pol_desc;This policy focuses on using no nuclear power at all and instead developing alternative energy sources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
agricultural_focus_pol_desc;Agriculture, also called farming or husbandry, is the cultivation of animals, plants, fungi, and other life forms for food, fiber, biofuel and other products used to sustain life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
commercial_focus_pol_desc;Commerce is the whole system of an economy that constitutes an environment for business. The system includes legal, economic, political, social, cultural, and technological systems that are in operation in any country. Thus, commerce is a system or an environment that affects the business prospects of an economy or a nation. It can also be defined as a component of business which includes all activities, functions and institutions involved in transferring goods from producers to consumer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
defence_focus_pol_desc;A military is an organization authorized by society to use lethal force, usually including use of weapons, in defending its country by combating actual or perceived threats. The military may have additional functions of use to its greater society, such as advancing a political agenda, e.g. military junta, supporting or promoting economic expansion through imperialism, and as a form of internal social control. This policy focuses on maintaining a strong military.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
educational_focus_pol_desc;Education in its general sense is a form of learning in which knowledge, skills, and habits of a group of people are transferred from one generation to the next through teaching, training, research, or simply through auto didacticism. Generally, it occurs through any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts. This policy focuses on cultivating well educated citizens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
health_focus_pol_desc;Healthcare is the overall system implemented in a country to maintain the good health of its citizens. It includes not only the treatment of disease, but also the prevention of disease and the maintenance of good health through health education. The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as 'a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.' This policy focuses on maintaining a healthy population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
industrial_focus_pol_desc;Industry is the production of an economic good or service within an economy. Industry is often classified into three sectors: primary or extractive, secondary or manufacturing, and tertiary or services. Some add quaternary (knowledge) or even quinary (culture and research) sectors. This policy is all about building a strong industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
social_focus_pol_desc;Social support is the perception and actuality that one is cared for, has assistance available from other people, and that one is part of a supportive social network. These supportive resources can be emotional (e.g., nurturance), tangible (e.g., financial assistance), informational (e.g., advice), or companionship (e.g., sense of belonging). This policy focus on developing a society that cares about its people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
state_controlled_aff_pol_desc;Complete state control is employed by governments – or more often by factions within governments – against that government's citizens, against factions within the government, or against foreign governments or groups. The systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective often goes hand in hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
repressive_aff_pol_desc;Political repression is the persecution of an individual or group for political reasons, particularly for the purpose of restricting or preventing their ability to take part in the political life of a society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
oppressive_aff_pol_desc;Oppression is the exercise of authority or power in a burdensome, cruel, or unjust manner. If oppressive consequences accrue to institutional laws, customs, or practices, the institution is oppressive whether or not the individuals maintaining those practices have oppressive intentions. This policy cements state control over society by ensuring that any dissenters are either too demoralized to oppose the regime, or are in prison where they have no voice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
liberal_aff_pol_desc;This policy supports the idea of a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a government that respects the freedom of the governed. A free society promotes creativity and dynamism, but it also places few obstacles in the way of dissenters and is therefore vulnerable to slipping into periods of social chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
democratic_aff_pol_desc;Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives. Democracy allows eligible citizens to participate equally—either directly or through elected representatives—in the proposal, development, and creation of laws. Democracy encompasses social, economic, and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
supply_side_eco_pol_desc;Supply-side economics is a school of macroeconomic thought that argues that economic growth can be most effectively created by lowering barriers for people to produce (supply) goods and services, such as lowering income tax and capital gains tax rates, and by allowing greater flexibility by reducing regulation. According to supply-side economics, consumers will then benefit from a greater supply of goods and services at lower prices. Typical policy recommendations of supply-side economists are lower marginal tax rates and less regulation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
